# Last Mile Delivery Tracker

This repository contains a Next.js application that provides a secure authentication and authorization foundation for the Last Mile Delivery Tracker platform. It includes signup, login, password reset, protected routes, and API infrastructure that can be extended for delivery operations.

Summary

- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Animations: GSAP / Framer Motion (where used)
- Purpose: Demonstration and implementation of authentication flows, protected routes, and UI components for an event-style site.

## Getting started

Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (or the version your monorepo requires)
- pnpm (recommended) — or npm / yarn

Install dependencies

```powershell
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

Run development server

```powershell
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Development

- Routes and pages live under `src/app/` (App Router).
- API endpoints are under `src/app/api/`.
- UI components live in `src/components/`.
- Utilities, db helpers and services are under `src/lib/` and `src/services/`.

Tip: Many pages use client components (`"use client"`) for animations and interactive UX.

## Build & Production

Build for production

```powershell
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Deploy: This project can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any Node-compatible host. If using Vercel, the app router is supported out of the box.

## Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` with the variables your app needs. Example variables used in this project (update names to match the actual code):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-site.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=some-secret
SMTP_URL=smtp://user:pass@smtp.example.com:587
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
TWILIO_SID=ACxxxx
TWILIO_TOKEN=xxxx
```

Only add secrets to `.env*` files and never commit them to source control.

## Project structure (high level)

Key folders under `src/`:

- `app/` — Next.js app routes and pages (App Router)
- `app/(auth)` — Authentication pages and flows (signup, login, password reset)
- `app/(protected)` — Layout and pages for protected routes
- `components/` — Reusable UI components (auth forms, landing, dashboard, ui primitives)
- `lib/` — Utilities, db connectors and helpers
- `services/` — Business logic (auth services, mail, token, user helpers)

Example files / entry points:

- `src/app/page.tsx` — Landing / home page
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Global layout
- `src/app/api/auth/...` — NextAuth and API routes

## Key components and features

- Authentication flows: Sign up, verify email, login, reset password, new password
- Protected routes and server-side checks
- Preloader and page transition animations (GSAP / Tailwind utility classes)
- Lenis-based smooth scroll on some landing pages

## Troubleshooting & common commands

- Run linting (if configured): `pnpm lint`
- Run tests (if present): `pnpm test`
- Format code: `pnpm format` or via your editor setup

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch: `feature/xyz`
3. Make changes and add tests
4. Open a pull request describing the change

Please follow the repository's code style and commit message guidelines.

## Where to find things

- Authentication pages: `src/app/(auth)`
- Page transition overlay component: `src/app/(routes)/_components/PageTransition.tsx` (controls tile animations)
- Landing scene & hero: `src/components/landing/*`

## License

This project does not include a license file. Add a `LICENSE` if you want to open-source it (MIT / Apache-2.0 are common choices).

---

If you want, I can:

- Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with PR and branch rules
- Add example `.env.local.example` with variable names used by the app
- Add automated scripts for lint/test/build in package.json

If you'd like me to write one of those now, tell me which and I'll add it.
